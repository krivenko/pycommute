TODO list
=========

* Consider adding a function (or a set of functions) to convert linear operators
  into a NumPy matrix form.
* Remove the workaround for pybind11 issue #2516 when it is fixed.
* Try to allow inheriting from `Generator` in Python if pybind11 issue #1546 and
  related issues are ever resolved.
